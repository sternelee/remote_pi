/**
 * Per-cwd singleton lock for `/remote-pi`. At most one Pi process per
 * working directory may hold the lock; the second attempt is refused.
 *
 * Why a UDS bind instead of a PID lock file:
 *   - The OS releases the socket handle the instant the process dies, even
 *     on `kill -9` or hard crash. No stale-lock cleanup needed.
 *   - The next Pi to try in the same cwd detects the dead socket via
 *     `ECONNREFUSED` on `tryConnect`, unlinks the leftover file, and
 *     binds successfully. Fully self-healing.
 *   - Kernel-enforced — there is no race window between "check if held"
 *     and "claim", which an explicit PID file would have.
 *
 * Lock files live in `<root>/.pi/remote/locks/<roomId>.sock` (where `roomId`
 * is `sha256(realpath(cwd))[:12]` and `<root>` is `$REMOTE_PI_HOME` or the
 * home dir), NOT inside the cwd itself, to dodge:
 *   - The 104/108-char path-length limit on UDS sockets on macOS/Linux.
 *   - Symlinked cwds (realpath canonicalization happens in `roomIdFor`).
 *   - Read-only cwds (the home directory is always writable).
 *
 * Caller workflow:
 *   const lock = await acquireCwdLock(cwd);
 *   if (!lock.ok) { ui.notify("Já tem um agente rodando nessa pasta."); return; }
 *   // …run /remote-pi normally; lock auto-releases on process exit
 */

 *  dir away from the developer's real state root via `REMOTE_PI_HOME` — same

 *

 * delegates to the shared `roomIdFor(cwd, name)`. So the per-(folder,name) lock
 * and the announced room stay in lockstep: a default/unnamed agent locks the
 * legacy cwd id (and owns the legacy room); a custom or `#N`-suffixed name gets

 *
 * Self-healing path: if the prior holder crashed, the leftover socket file
 * fails `tryConnect` (ECONNREFUSED). We unlink it and retry the bind — the
 * second attempt then succeeds.
 *
 * The server holds no actual listener logic; its only job is to keep the
