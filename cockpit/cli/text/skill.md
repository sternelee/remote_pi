name: cockpit-cli
description: Drive Cockpit's multiplexed terminals from inside a tab. Use when you (an agent running in a Cockpit terminal) need to open a new terminal tab or split pane, type text or press keys into your own or another tab, read another tab's or a task's output, list the open tabs/workspaces/tasks, or query the workspace's databases (SQL over registered connections / .dbq files). Triggers on tmux-like control needs — split-window/new-window, send-keys, run a command in another tab, read a tab's scrollback, inspect a task run's output, discover tab or task ids — and on database needs: run a SQL query, inspect a schema, list connections, execute a .dbq file. Also covers pane-layout orchestration: applying a `.ckp` layout file (open several terminals/splits and run their commands) via `cockpit orchestrate`. Also covers `.kanban` board files: the markdown format the app renders as a kanban board (columns, cards, labels, notes, comments) — read it when asked to create, read or update a board, a task list or a roadmap the human can open in Cockpit. Also covers `.notebook` folders (a notebook of tagged markdown notes the human reads in the app) and the `cockpit note` verb that writes into one.

# cockpit — Cockpit's internal CLI

You are running inside a **Cockpit** terminal (an IDE that multiplexes
terminals). The `cockpit` command talks to the app and lets you **inject
text/keys** into any tab and **list** tabs/workspaces. It only exists inside
Cockpit tabs (it is not on the global PATH).

`ck` is the same binary under a shorter name — use whichever you prefer
(`ck list-tabs` == `cockpit list-tabs`). Every example below works with both.

> **Tab vs pane.** A **tab** is a single terminal/agent session — that's the
> unit this CLI addresses (`--tab-id`). A **pane** is the split leaf that can
> hold several tabs; the CLI does not address it. `list-panes`/`read-pane` and
> `$COCKPIT_PANE_ID` are **legacy aliases** of `list-tabs`/`read-tab`/
> `$COCKPIT_TAB_ID` — prefer the new names.

## Verbs

- `cockpit send [--tab-id <id>] [--enter] <text>` — type literal text; add
  `--enter` to submit it (equivalent to a `send-key Enter` right after).
  `--focused` targets whichever tab the human is looking at (the app resolves
  it) — meant for tools driven by the human, not for agent orchestration, where
  an explicit `--tab-id` is what keeps you from typing into the wrong tab.
- `cockpit send-key [--tab-id <id>] <Key>...` — press key(s): `Enter`, `Tab`,
  `Escape`, `Space`, `BSpace`, `Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right`, `Home`/`End`,
  `PageUp`/`PageDown`, `Delete`, and `C-<letter>` (e.g. `C-c` = Ctrl+C).
- `cockpit new-tab [--cwd <dir>] [--title <name>] [--split h|v]` — open a new
  **terminal tab** in the app and print its id (`t12`). `--cwd` defaults to
  your current directory; `--title` sets the stable tab label (so `send`/
  `read-tab` can target it by name). Without `--split` the tab opens in the
  same pane (next to yours); `--split h` (or `right`) splits side by side,
  `--split v` (or `down`) stacks — tmux semantics. Capture the id to drive it:

  ```sh
  id=$(cockpit new-tab --cwd ~/proj --title Worker --split h)
  cockpit send --tab-id "$id" --enter "npm test"
  ```
- `cockpit close-tab [<label|tab-id>]` — close a tab and print its id: the
  counterpart of `new-tab`. **Without a target it closes YOUR OWN tab**, which
  ends the shell you are typing in — pass the target explicitly unless that is
  what you mean. Closing the last tab of a split removes the split; closing the
  last tab of a workspace leaves an empty tab behind (same as the tab's "x").

  ```sh
  id=$(cockpit new-tab --cwd ~/proj --title Worker)
  cockpit close-tab "$id"     # or: cockpit close-tab Worker
  ```
- `cockpit open [--tab-id <id>] <file>` — open the file in the app's viewer
  (tab next to the terminal). `cockpit <file>` is the shortcut. The path is
  resolved against the tab cwd (relative, `~` and absolute all work). Any type
  opens as text — including extensionless ones (`.zprofile`, `Makefile`).
- `cockpit exec [--cwd <dir>] [--timeout <s>] [--json] [--] <command...>` —
  run a shell line through the app (login shell, so your PATH applies) and
  print its output; the exit code is the command's. `--json` prints
  `{ok, code, stdout, stderr, timedOut}` on one line. This is what `.panel`
  buttons use under the hood; from a terminal you already have a shell, so
  prefer it only when you want the app's environment (`cockpit` on PATH,
  `COCKPIT_TAB_ID` set) from outside a Cockpit tab.
- `cockpit browse <url> [--json]` — open the app's built-in **browser tab** at
  `<url>` (e.g. a dev server you just started: `cockpit browse
  http://localhost:3000`). A browser tab already open on the same host:port is
  reused (it navigates/reloads instead of duplicating). Schemeless URLs get
  `http://` for localhost targets and `https://` otherwise. On platforms
  without an inline webview (Linux) the URL opens in the system browser —
  `--json` output tells you which happened: `{"mode":"inline"|"system","url":…}`.
- `cockpit db <list|schema|query|run|execute>` — query the workspace's
  databases. Connections are registered in `.cockpit/databases.json` (Database
  panel); SQLite files in the repo are auto-detected. Output is **one JSON
  line**: `{"ok":{columns,rows,rowCount,truncated,elapsedMs}}` or
  `{"error":{kind,message}}` (exit 1). The app executes everything — you never
  see credentials. Examples:
  - `cockpit db list` — available connections (name, engine, target).
  - `cockpit db schema --db dev-local` / `… --db dev-local orders` — tables /
    columns of a table.
  - `cockpit db query --db dev-local --sql "SELECT …" [--limit N]` — rows are
    arrays (column order matches `columns`); `truncated: true` means the limit
    cut the cursor — raise `--limit` if you need more.
  - `cockpit db execute --db dev-local --sql "UPDATE …"` — returns
    `affectedRows`. **Connections are read-only for agents by default**: any
    write is rejected with kind `read_only_connection` until the human enables
    "Allow writes (agents)" on the connection in the Database panel — if you
    hit it, ask the human instead of working around it. `db list` shows each
    connection's `access` field (`read` | `readwrite`).
  - `cockpit db run <file.dbq>` — runs a `.dbq` file (SQL with `-- db:` /
    `-- limit:` comment frontmatter). Prefer writing a `.dbq` when the human
    should see the result too: the app shows it as a query tab and re-runs it
    every time you save the file.
  - Outside a Cockpit tab, add `--workspace <id|path>`.
- `cockpit http <list|run> <file.http>` — runs HTTP requests written in a
  `.http` file (REST Client / JetBrains HTTP Client syntax: `###` separates
  requests, `@name = value` declares a variable, `{{name}}` interpolates it).
  - `cockpit http list api/users.http` — the requests in the file, with their
    index, name, method and URL.
  - `cockpit http run api/users.http [--request <name|index>]` — runs one
    (default: the first). Output is one JSON line: `{"ok":{"status":200,
    "headers":{…},"elapsedMs":12,"json":{…}}}`; the body comes back as `json`
    when it parses as JSON, otherwise as `body`. A 4xx/5xx is a normal
    response — check `status`, not the exit code.
  - Prefer writing a `.http` when the human should see the request too: the app
    renders the same file as a request tab (editor + response), so they can
    re-run and tweak it themselves.
  - Outside a Cockpit tab, add `--workspace <id|path>`.
- `cockpit redis --db <conn> <CMD> [args...]` — Redis/cache command. One
  JSON line reply. e.g. `cockpit redis --db cache HGETALL user:42`. Covers
  Redis/Valkey/KeyDB.
- `cockpit mongo --db <conn> [--database <name>] --command '<json>'` — MongoDB
  runCommand. The command is a runCommand document, e.g.
  `cockpit mongo --db app --command '{"find":"users","filter":{"active":true}}'`.
  Output: one JSON line `{"ok": <reply>}` / `{"error":{kind,message}}`.
  Documents use relaxed extended JSON (`{"$oid":…}`, `{"$date":…}`) both ways.
  - **Which database it runs against**: the one in the connection URL's path,
    if it has one; otherwise the one the human picked in the Database panel;
    otherwise the command fails and the error lists the databases available.
    `--database <name>` overrides all of it **for that call only** — it never
    changes what the human is looking at, so prefer it whenever you are not
    sure. Atlas URLs (`mongodb+srv://…/?…`) carry no database, so a connection
    can legitimately have none until someone picks one.
  - Discover databases with `--command '{"listDatabases":1}'` (routed to
    `admin` for you — that is the only database the server accepts it on), then
    collections with
    `--database <name> --command '{"listCollections":1,"nameOnly":true}'`.
    Running `listCollections` without knowing the database is the classic
    mistake: you get `system.users`/`system.roles`/`system.version` back, which
    is the `admin` database answering — not an empty deployment.
- **Browse commands open a view for the human — they return no data.** Use
  them to *show* what you found (after investigating with the commands above),
  not to query:
  - `cockpit redis browse --db <conn> [--pattern 'user:*']` — opens the
    editable Redis key table, pre-filtered. On an already-open table the
    pattern **replaces** the current filter.
  - `cockpit mongo browse --db <conn> [--database <name>] <collection>
    [--filter '<json>']` — here `--database` **does** change the connection's
    current database, because the tab you open becomes what the human sees —
    opens the Mongo collection browser (JSON document cards) pre-filtered.
    The filter lands in the visible filter bar, editable by the human.
- **Registering a connection** (`.cockpit/databases.json` at the workspace
  root — the file behind `cockpit db list` and the Database panel):

  ```json
  {
    "databases": [
      {"name": "dev-local", "url": "sqlite:./app.db", "savePassword": false},
      {"name": "app", "url": "postgres://user@localhost:5432/appdb", "savePassword": false},
      {"name": "cache", "url": "redis://localhost:6379/0", "savePassword": false},
      {"name": "docs", "url": "mongodb://localhost:27017/appdb", "savePassword": false}
    ]
  }
  ```

  The URL never carries the password — the human enters it in the Database
  panel (stored in the OS keychain when `savePassword` is on). A personal,
  gitignored overlay lives in `.cockpit/databases.local.json` (same shape,
  merged on top by name). The panel picks up edits on reload; `cockpit db
  list` confirms what's registered.
- **Connecting through a bastion (SSH tunnel)** — a connection may carry an
  optional `ssh` block. The app opens the tunnel and points the driver at a
  local port; every `cockpit db|redis|mongo` command works unchanged.

  ```json
  {
    "databases": [
      {
        "name": "prod",
        "url": "postgres://appuser@localhost:5432/appdb",
        "savePassword": true,
        "ssh": {
          "host": "bastion.acme.dev",
          "port": 22,
          "user": "deploy",
          "keyPath": "~/.ssh/id_ed25519",
          "savePassphrase": false
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  With a tunnel, the database `host`/`port` are resolved **from the SSH
  server** — `localhost` means the bastion itself, not your machine.
  Authentication is **key only**; the block never holds a secret (the
  passphrase, when the key has one, lives in the OS keychain).

  **Agents need the credential pre-saved.** If the key is passphrase-protected
  and the human hasn't enabled "Save passphrase" on the connection, your
  command fails fast with kind `ssh_credential_required` — there is no prompt
  on the CLI path. Ask the human to enable it rather than working around it.
  Other SSH failures come back as `ssh_host_key_unknown` (first connection
  must be approved once in the UI), `ssh_host_key_changed`, `ssh_auth_failed`,
  `ssh_key_missing` and `ssh_connect_failed`.

  **How the tunnel routes**, which matters when you read a failure: SQL engines
  and Redis go through a local **port forward** (they speak to one address).
  MongoDB goes through a local **SOCKS5 proxy** instead, because the driver
  discovers replica set members via `hello` and then dials the hostnames the
  server announces — a fixed local port would only ever reach the first node,
  and `mongodb+srv://` not even that. With SOCKS the driver picks each
  destination and the tunnel just routes, so Atlas/SRV and replica sets work
  unchanged. This requires a MongoDB driver built with SOCKS5 support; without
  it the driver rejects `proxyHost` loudly rather than connecting directly.
- `cockpit read-tab [<label|tab-id>] [--lines N] [--offset N] [--from-start]`
  (alias: `read-pane`) — read a tab's **rendered output** as plain text (no
  ANSI escapes; covers TUIs on the alt-screen too). Without a target it reads
  your **own** tab; a target may be a stable tab `label` or a tab-id. Default
  window: the **last 100 lines** (tail). `--lines N` sets the window size
  (server cap 2000); `--from-start` anchors at the beginning of the buffer
  instead of the end; `--offset N` skips N lines from the chosen anchor
  (pagination: read the last 100, then `--lines 100 --offset 100` for the 100
  before those). Output is always chronological (top→bottom) — the flags only
  pick the window.
- `cockpit read-task <task-id> [--lines N] [--offset N] [--from-start]` — same
  windowed read, but for a **task run's** output (the Task Run feature). Works
  even if no task-output tab is open, but only for tasks that ran this boot.
  Discover ids with `cockpit list-tasks` (never guess them).
- `cockpit list-tasks [--json]` — tasks of **your workspace** (the one owning
  the current tab, or `--tab-id`'s): `id`, `label`, `kind` (watch|oneShot),
  `source` (detected|manual), `running`, `hasOutput` (`read-task` has output
  to read). Ids are stable per workspace: `npm:<script>` (package.json
  scripts), `flutter:run`/`flutter:test`, `json:<label>`
  (`.cockpit/tasks.json`). With `--json` each task also lists its `profiles`
  and interactive `keys`.
- `cockpit run-task <task-id> [--profile <name>] [--restart]`,
  `cockpit stop-task <task-id>`, `cockpit restart-task <task-id>`,
  `cockpit send-task-key <task-id> <key>` — drive the **Tasks panel** from a
  tab: start a task (fails if already running unless `--restart`), stop it,
  restart it with the same profile, or write an interactive key to its stdin
  (`r` = hot reload, `R` = hot restart on Flutter; the keys come from
  `list-tasks --json`). Same runner the human sees in the panel, so state and
  output stay in sync; works on local and remote workspaces (the task runs
  where the workspace lives). Prefer `send-task-key` over a restart when the
  task offers a reload key — it is what the human would press.

  ```sh
  cockpit list-tasks --json                 # ids, profiles, keys
  cockpit run-task npm:dev                  # start the dev server
  cockpit send-task-key flutter:run r       # hot reload after an edit
  cockpit restart-task npm:dev              # config changed, reload won't do
  cockpit read-task npm:dev --lines 40      # check what it printed
  ```
- `cockpit list-tabs [--json]` (alias: `list-panes`) — active tabs: `id`,
  `kind` (terminal|agent|file|task), `title` (dynamic), `label` (manual stable
  name, or null), `workspaceId` (opaque UUID), `workspacePath` (workspace root
  on disk), `working`, and `taskId` on task-output tabs (the id `read-task`
  accepts). Resolve a tab by its stable `label`, not the dynamic `title`.
- `cockpit list-workspaces [--json]` — open projects: `id` (opaque UUID),
  `name`, `path` (root on disk), `tabs`.
- `cockpit new-workspace <path> [--host <ssh-target>] [--name <title>] [--json]`
  (aliases: `open-workspace`, `new-remote-workspace`) — add `<path>` as a top-level
  project in Cockpit's rail (local or remote), select it, and ensure an initial
  terminal tab is opened. For remote workspaces, pass `--host` (SSH host or
  `~/.ssh/config` alias). Idempotent: focuses an already open workspace.
  Prints the workspace id (or full object with `--json`).
- `cockpit close-workspace [<id|path>] [--json]` — remove a top-level project
  from Cockpit (ends its tabs; files on disk are kept). Target may be an id,
  path, or unique name (default: current workspace). Prints the closed workspace id.
- `cockpit rename-workspace [<id|path>] <new-name> [--json]` — update the
  display title of a workspace in the rail. Target may be an id, path, or
  unique name (default: current workspace).
- `cockpit orchestrate <file.ckp> [--append] [--json]` — apply a **pane
  layout** to the current workspace: opens the terminals/splits declared in
  the file and types each pane's `command`. By default the workspace
  **becomes** the layout: every open tab is closed first, with no
  confirmation, then the panes are created. The tab you run the command from
  is the only one kept (closing it would kill the CLI mid-call).
  An invalid file closes nothing. With `--append` the open tabs are kept and
  the layout is merged on top (idempotent: a pane whose `name` already exists
  as a tab label is skipped, so running it twice is a no-op). Prints
  `closed:`/`created:`/`skipped:` (or `{"created":[],"skipped":[],"closed":0}`
  with `--json`).

## Layout files (`*.ckp`)

A `.ckp` file is a versionable YAML describing terminals to open in a
workspace — the Cockpit equivalent of a tmuxinator layout. One file = one
layout; the layout takes the file's name.

```yaml
# dev.ckp — lives anywhere in the project (usually the root)
autorun: worktree        # optional: auto-apply when a worktree of this
                         # workspace is created (the only autorun trigger)
panes:
  - name: Frontend       # required, unique; becomes the tab's stable label
    cwd: frontend        # relative to this file, forward slashes ONLY
    command: claude      # optional; typed into the shell after it boots
  - name: Backend
    cwd: backend
    split: right         # tab (default) | right (side by side) | down (stack)
    command: npm run dev
    platforms: [macos, linux]   # optional; omit = all OSes
```

Rules:
- `cwd` must be **relative** with `/` separators — absolute paths and `\`
  are rejected so the same committed file works on macOS, Linux and Windows.
- `split` is relative to the **previous pane created in this run**; if that
  one was skipped (merge), the next opens as a plain tab.
- `platforms` accepts a string or list of `macos`/`windows`/`linux`.
- In the app, right-click a `.ckp` file → **Open layout** does the same as
  `cockpit orchestrate` (replace); the app asks for confirmation only when a
  tab to be closed has a running process.

## Board files (`*.kanban`)

A `.kanban` file is a **markdown board**: the app renders it as columns and
cards, but it stays plain markdown on disk. There is no `cockpit kanban`
verb and you do not need one — **edit the file with your normal file tools**.
The open tab reloads by itself as soon as you save.

Use `cockpit open board.kanban` to put it in front of the human.

```markdown
---
title: Roadmap                                   # the tab's label
columns: [Backlog, Doing, Review, Done]          # documentation; `##` is what counts
labels: {relay: orange, bug: red, ui: purple}    # name -> palette color
---

## Doing

- [ ] Túnel SSH no host <!-- id: k3 labels: relay, infra -->
      Free markdown note, indented under the title.

      <!-- comment: 2026-09-07T08:30 -->
      Newest comment.

      <!-- comment: 2026-09-06T19:22 -->
      Older comment.

## Done

- [x] Absorver o plugin de PTY <!-- id: k1 -->
```

Rules that matter when you write one:
- **Columns are `##` headings**; cards are top-level `- [ ]` / `- [x]` items
  under them. Order in the file is the order on screen.
- **The last column means done.** The app keeps `[x]` in sync with position,
  so move a card *and* flip its checkbox together — a `[x]` sitting in
  `Backlog` is the one inconsistency the human will see.
- **Ids are optional.** Write cards without `<!-- id: -->`; the app injects one
  the first time the card is moved from the UI. Keep an id you find — it is
  how the card is tracked across edits.
- **Labels** are `labels: a, b` inside the card's HTML comment, and only get a
  color if the frontmatter declares one. An undeclared label still works (grey).
- **Notes** are the indented lines right under the title, up to the first
  comment marker.
- **Comments** are blocks opened by `<!-- comment: <ISO minute> -->`, indented
  like the note. **Newest first**: insert a new one directly *above* the
  existing ones (right after the note), so file order is reading order.
- **Anything the parser does not model survives.** A stray paragraph inside a
  column shows up as a read-only card instead of being dropped, and no edit
  the app makes ever rewrites the whole file — so your formatting, comments and
  blank lines stay put.

Two things to prefer:
- Writing a `.kanban` beats reporting a plan in chat when the human should be
  able to follow it later: the board is a file they can open, drag and commit.
- Editing the file beats driving the UI. Keep the diff small (the app does the
  same — a card move is a three-line diff), and never reformat the whole file.

## Panel files (`*.panel`)

A `.panel` file is a **live HTML page** with a bridge to the app: the tab runs
the page in a web view and injects `window.cockpit`, so buttons and scripts in
it can run Cockpit CLI verbs and shell commands on this machine. Use it as a
playground: a quick dashboard to validate something, a form that triggers a
task, a status board that polls `git`/`db`. One file, no server, no ports.

Write it with your normal file tools (`cockpit open x.panel` puts it in front
of the human). The open tab reloads by itself when you save. The file is a
plain HTML document with an optional YAML frontmatter on top:

```html
---
title: Repo status     # tab label (default: file name)
reload: true           # reload the page when the file changes (default true)
cwd: .                 # working dir for exec/CLI calls, relative to this file
---
<!doctype html>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<style>body { background: var(--ckp-bg); color: var(--ckp-text) }</style>
<button onclick="run()">git status</button>
<pre id="out"></pre>
<script>
async function run() {
  const r = await cockpit("exec git status --short");
  document.getElementById("out").textContent = r.ok ? r.stdout : r.error;
}
</script>
```

The bridge is one function. `await cockpit("<line>")` runs `cockpit <line>`
exactly as you would type it in a tab, and resolves to
`{ok, code, stdout, stderr, json, error}`: `json` is the parsed stdout when
the verb printed JSON (`list-tabs --json`, `db query`, `exec --json`),
`error` is the stderr (or the exit code) when `ok` is false. Anything the CLI
can do, a panel can do: `db query main 'select ...'`, `exec npm test`,
`send --tab-id t3 --enter 'make'`, `run-task npm:dev`, `note add ...`.
`cockpit.on("theme", vars => ...)` fires when the app theme changes;
`cockpit.theme` holds the current `--ckp-*` CSS variables (`--ckp-bg`,
`--ckp-text`, `--ckp-text-muted`, `--ckp-border`, `--ckp-code-bg`,
`--ckp-link`, `--ckp-accent`), already set on `:root` so plain CSS can use
them. Relative assets (`<img src="chart.png">`, `<script src="app.js">`)
resolve inside the file's folder only. External links open in the OS browser.
There is no allowlist: a panel can run anything the human could run in a tab,
so only put in it what you would type yourself.

## Notebooks (`*.notebook`)

A folder whose name ends in `.notebook` is a **notebook**: one markdown file
per note, each with a small YAML frontmatter. The app shows the folder as a
single item in the file tree and opens it as a notes tab — notes grouped by
tag on the left, the note on the right. Obsidian opens the same folder as-is.

Write notes here while you work when the human should be able to read them
later: findings, decisions, open questions, a summary of what you changed.
Prefer **many short notes with tags** over one long file.

```markdown
---
title: Túnel SSH no host
tags: [relay, agent]
created: 2026-09-07T10:12
updated: 2026-09-07T11:40
---

Body in plain markdown.
```

The easy way is the verb — it writes the frontmatter for you, picks a unique
file name (`2026-09-07-tunel-ssh-no-host.md`) and refreshes the open tab:

```sh
cockpit note add notes.notebook --title "Túnel SSH no host" --tag relay \
  --body "Porta 2222 fechada no firewall; abri via ufw."
cockpit note add notes.notebook --title "Resumo da sessão" --body - <<'NOTE'
- Corrigi o parser do .kanban
- Falta: testes do watcher
NOTE
cockpit note list notes.notebook          # title  [tags]  path
```

Rules that matter:
- `--tag` may repeat. The **`agent` tag is always added** by the verb — it is
  how the human tells your notes from theirs. Keep it if you edit a note by
  hand.
- A note without frontmatter still works (title = file name, no tag), so
  editing an existing `.md` with your normal file tools is fine. The tab
  reloads by itself.
- The **file name never changes** when the title changes; the title is
  metadata. Don't rename files to "fix" titles.
- Keep the frontmatter keys as they are (`title`, `tags`, `created`,
  `updated`); the app rewrites only those lines and leaves the body untouched.
- **Link notes with `[[Title]]`** (exact title, case-insensitive). The app
  renders it as a clickable chip and lists backlinks on the target note. Use
  it to connect a finding to the decision it led to, or a summary to the
  notes it summarizes.
- Images: put files under `_assets/` inside the notebook and reference them
  as `![](_assets/name.png)` — the app draws them inline.
- Diagrams: a ```mermaid fence (flowchart, sequence, class, state, gantt…)
  renders as a diagram in the app's markdown preview, in notes and in any
  `.md` file. Prefer it over ASCII art when explaining a flow.

## Telemetry (the error store) — query it instead of reading terminals

The app keeps a structured, per-workspace store of what the workspace's
processes print: errors grouped by fingerprint (type + normalized message +
first project frame), JSON log lines with their fields, and raw lines with a
guessed level. **Every task the app runs feeds it by default.** Anything you
run yourself enters it only through the wrapper.

### Rule of thumb

- If a task exists for what you want to run: `cockpit run-task <id>` (already
  observed). Otherwise **prefix the command**: `cockpit telemetry flutter test`,
  `cockpit telemetry --name api npm run dev`. Works from your own shell
  (pipes) and from a terminal tab (nested PTY, keys and colors preserved).
- Never `read-tab` thousands of lines when a run exists. The wrapper prints a
  summary line at exit; follow it:

  ```
  telemetry: run r_42 · 3 errors · 12 warnings · cockpit telemetry errors --run r_42
  ```

### The loop

```sh
cockpit telemetry flutter test            # run → summary line
cockpit telemetry errors --run r_42       # grouped cases, ids e_xxxx
cockpit telemetry show e_3f2a             # stack (project frames flagged), the
                                          # JSON log right before it, context lines
# fix the code, then either run again, or on a dev server with hot reload:
cockpit telemetry wait --fingerprint e_3f2a --absent 30s   # ok | hit | inconclusive
cockpit telemetry resolve e_3f2a --reason "off-by-one in CartService.add"
```

Useful filters: `--new` (never seen in earlier runs of the same command),
`--since-edit` (since the human's last editor save), `--since 10m`,
`--before ev_xxxx --window 5s`, `--project <root>`, `--text <words>`,
`--probe <name>`. Replies are capped: `"truncated": true` comes with a `hint`.
Human triage is respected: resolved/ignored cases are hidden unless you pass
`--include-resolved` / `--include-ignored`. A resolved case that comes back is
flagged `"regression": true`.

### Make the project speak telemetry (permanent instrumentation)

One rule: **the project's logger emits JSON Lines to stdout**. No SDK.

| Stack | Recipe |
|---|---|
| Flutter / Dart | `logging` package with a listener doing `print(jsonEncode({...}))`; also `FlutterError.onError` and `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError` printing `{"level":"error","msg":..., "err":{"type":..., "message":..., "stack":...}}` |
| Node / TS | `pino` (JSON by default) or `console.log(JSON.stringify({...}))` |
| Python | `structlog` with `JSONRenderer`, or `python-json-logger` |
| Rust | `tracing-subscriber` with `.json()` |
| Go | `slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil)` |

Canonical shape (aliases accepted: `severity`/`lvl`, `message`, `ts`/`timestamp`,
`error`/`stack`; pino's numeric levels work):

```json
{"level":"error","msg":"cart add failed","err":{"type":"RangeError","message":"index 3 of 2","stack":"#0 ..."},"itemId":"abc","total":42}
```

**Write messages that group well**: keep `msg` fixed and put variable data in
fields. `"msg":"order failed","orderId":"91c"` is one case; `"msg":"order 91c
failed"` becomes one case per order.

Do **not** gate logs on `COCKPIT_*` env vars: the app must behave the same
inside and outside Cockpit (the vars never reach a phone or a container
anyway). Control verbosity with the project's own knob (`LOG_LEVEL`,
`kReleaseMode`), set per task via `env` in `.cockpit/tasks.json`.

### Temporary probes while investigating

Sprinkle JSON prints with a `probe` field, e.g.
`print(jsonEncode({'probe':'cart','items':cart.length}))`, then filter with
`cockpit telemetry logs --probe cart`. **Never commit a probe**:
`cockpit telemetry probes` lists added lines in the working tree that still
carry one; remove them before committing.

### Per-task opt-out and config

`"telemetry": false` on a task in `.cockpit/tasks.json` keeps that task out.
`.cockpit/telemetry.json` (optional, versioned) can add `unwrap` regexes for
odd log prefixes and `ignore` patterns.

## Target (--tab-id)

Without `--tab-id`, the command acts on **your own tab** (via `$COCKPIT_TAB_ID`,
legacy fallback `$COCKPIT_PANE_ID`). To drive **another** tab, pass
`--tab-id <id>`.

> Ids (`t0`, `t1`…) are sequential and **change on every app boot**. Never
> guess an id: run `cockpit list-tabs` first and use the `id` from there.

## Usage pattern

To run a command in a tab, use `--enter` (the text alone is only typed, not
submitted):

```sh
cockpit send --enter "npm test"
```

`--enter` presses Enter as a separate keystroke right after the text, which is
what TUIs expect. The two-step form still works when you need to type something
and press a different key:

```sh
cockpit send "npm test"
cockpit send-key Enter
```

Cross-tab (drive another tab):

```sh
cockpit list-tabs                        # find the target id, e.g. t4
cockpit send --tab-id t4 --enter "git status"
```

Interrupt a stuck process in another tab:

```sh
cockpit send-key --tab-id t4 C-c
```

Read what another tab printed (e.g. check on a worker, debug a failure):

```sh
cockpit read-tab t4 --lines 50            # last 50 lines of t4
cockpit read-tab Extension                # by stable label (last 100 lines)
cockpit read-tab t4 --lines 100 --offset 100   # the 100 lines before those
```

Read a task run's output (dev server, build, test — the Task Run feature):

```sh
cockpit list-tasks                        # ids: ● = running, [output] = readable
cockpit read-task npm:dev --lines 80      # tail of the "npm:dev" task output
```

Typical loop — dispatch work to a tab, wait, then read the result:

```sh
cockpit send --tab-id t4 --enter "npm test"
# poll `cockpit list-tabs --json` until t4 shows "working": false, then:
cockpit read-tab t4 --lines 60
```

## Common errors

- "COCKPIT_STATUS_SOCK is unset" → you are not inside a Cockpit terminal.
- "tab ... does not exist" → stale id (app reboot). Run `list-tabs` again.
- "tab ... is not a terminal" → the target is an agent/file tab, not a shell.
- "has no readable output" → read-tab target is an agent/file tab; only
  terminal and task-output tabs are readable.
- "no output recorded for task ..." → the task never ran this app boot, or the
  id is wrong — check both with `cockpit list-tasks` (`[output]` = readable).
