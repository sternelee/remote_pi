                <p>
                  You can also apply it from inside any Cockpit terminal, which
                  is how an agent sets up its own workspace:
                </p>
                <CodeBlock

                    That one line is the payoff. Every time you fork the
                    workspace onto a fresh git worktree, Cockpit applies the
                    layout by itself — and since a new worktree starts empty, the
                    splits come out exactly as written. Keep a single autorun
                    file at the root: with two or more, none of them runs, because
                    ambiguity is never guessed.

                  The file goes at the root of the workspace you open — discovery
                  is literal, with no walking up the tree. Each task&apos;s{" "}
                  <InlineCode>cwd</InlineCode> is relative to that file, which is
                  what lets one file at the monorepo root drive every subpackage.
